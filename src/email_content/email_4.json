    "THIS IS EMAIL NO 2",

    "Half a lifetime ago, on a warm and sunny late spring day in 2001, I delivered the address at my high school graduation ceremony. I was (and remain) honored to have been selected to give the speech, and I wrote the finest address my 18-year-old self could muster. It had its moments, to be sure, with a balance of humor and solemnity and a bit of advice for my fellow graduates. But with apologies to my younger self, I have to admit that my commencement address probably won’t find its way onto any list like this one; it was perfectly adequate for the occasion, but hardly a timeless piece of oratory.",
